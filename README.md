Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
The project Exoplanet-Exploration is about creating machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

# Steps

1) Read the CSV and Perform Basic Data Cleaning
2) Create a Train Test Split
3) Pre-processing (Scale the data using the MinMaxScaler)
4) Train the Support Vector Machine
5) Hyperparameter Tuning
